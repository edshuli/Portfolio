# Edna Shuli Portfolio

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This website is my online resume-portofolio to present to prospective employers and other developers who might want to collaborate
with me. The portofolio provides information my coding skills, about myslef, my work and education experience and a contact form.

Please be free to take a closer look <a href="https://edshuli.github.io/Portfolio/" target="_blank">here.</a>

## UX

My goald in the design of the website is to prvide an easy access to all the important information on the site while allowing
the users to become familiar with it by maintaining the consistency. I choosed a violet-gold color scheme to create a warm
and modern felling.

For employers and other developers I have included on the site important information about my coding skills, where I have worked before 
my education history and short briefing about myself. I also wanted them to have an easy
access to my repositories and work with a link to GitHub, LinkedIn and a downloadable PDF version of my CV.
There is also a contact form so it will make them easier to contact me. 

## Technologies

1.HTML</br>
2.CSS </br>
3.Bootstrap v4.3

## Features

The navigation-bar stays fixed at the top, it has a transparent background-color with gold-color menu items. But on width max-767
the navbar stays collapsed and fixed on the top to provide an easy access to menu items.

## Features Left to Implement

In the future I would like to change the progress-bars, add some animation hover or even change the whole style maybe make it a circle.
I also would like to add more projects on my portfolio and make somme changes on the navbar.

## Testing
